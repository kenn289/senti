The project aims to build a machine learning model that performs sentiment analysis on social media posts (e.g., tweets, Facebook posts, etc.). Sentiment analysis helps determine whether a text conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, which can be useful for social media monitoring, brand analysis, and customer feedback analysis.
