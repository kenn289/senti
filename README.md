Project Name: Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Posts

Description:
The project aims to build a machine learning model that performs sentiment analysis on social media posts (e.g., tweets, Facebook posts, etc.). Sentiment analysis helps determine whether a text conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, which can be useful for social media monitoring, brand analysis, and customer feedback analysis.

Features:

Data Collection: Develop a script to scrape social media posts from platforms like Twitter or use APIs to gather data.

Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data to remove noise, such as special characters, hashtags, and URLs.

Feature Extraction: Use techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

Machine Learning Model: Train a sentiment analysis model using popular algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Deep Learning-based models like LSTM or BERT.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Web Interface: Create a simple web interface using Flask to allow users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results.

Visualization: Generate visualizations, such as word clouds or bar plots, to display sentiment distributions.

Real-time Sentiment Analysis: Implement a real-time sentiment analysis feature to analyze new social media posts as they come in.

Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model using platforms like Heroku or Docker to make the sentiment analysis service accessible online.

Continuous Integration: Set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions to automatically test and deploy the application.
